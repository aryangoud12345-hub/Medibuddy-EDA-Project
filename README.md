Exploratory Data Analysis of Medibuddy insurance policy 
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Health Insurance Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a health insurance dataset to understand how demographic and lifestyle factors influence **insurance charges**. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, correlations, outliers, and cost-driving variables that can support **data-driven business and policy decisions**.

The project is suitable for:

* Data Analytics / Data Science portfolios
* Academic assignments
* Insurance risk analysis use cases

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about individuals and their medical insurance charges. Key variables include:

| Column         | Description               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| age            | Age of the individual     |
| sex            | Gender of the individual  |
| bmi            | Body Mass Index           |
| children       | Number of dependents      |
| smoker         | Smoking status (Yes/No)   |
| region         | Residential region        |
| charges_in_INR | Medical insurance charges |

## 🔍 EDA Objectives

* Understand the distribution of insurance charges
* Identify key factors influencing medical costs
* Compare charges across risk groups
* Detect outliers and high-cost customers
* Support feature selection for predictive modeling

---

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights

### 1️⃣ Charges Distribution by Smoking Status (Box Plot)

* Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers
* Smoking is a major cost-driving factor
* Smokers show higher variability and extreme outliers

### 2️⃣ Risk Score vs Insurance Charges (Bar Chart)

* Higher risk scores generally lead to higher charges
* Risk score is a strong indicator of expected insurance cost
* Minor fluctuations suggest influence of additional factors

### 3️⃣ Top 10 Highest Insurance Charges (Bar Chart)

* A small number of individuals contribute disproportionately to total costs
* Highlights the presence of high-risk, high-cost customers
* Useful for targeted intervention and risk management

### 4️⃣ Correlation Heatmap

* Smoking shows the strongest correlation with charges (~0.79)
* Age and BMI have moderate positive correlations
* Children, sex, and region have minimal impact
* Low multicollinearity among predictors

### 5️⃣ Pair Plot (Scatterplot Matrix)

* Charges increase with age and BMI
* Charges distribution is highly right-skewed
* Children count shows little influence on charges
* Clear clustering of high-cost individuals

## 💡 Key Takeaways

* **Smoking is the most influential factor** affecting insurance charges
* **Age and BMI** are important secondary drivers
* Insurance costs are **highly skewed**, driven by a small high-risk group
* Preventive healthcare and wellness programs can reduce long-term costs

---

## 🚀 Business Impact

* Enables accurate **risk-based pricing**
* Supports **customer segmentation** and premium optimization
* Helps insurers design **preventive and wellness strategies**
* Improves predictive modeling and underwriting decisions

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Conclusion

This EDA provides clear, actionable insights into healthcare insurance costs and highlights the importance of lifestyle factors in risk assessment. The findings can be directly leveraged for business strategy, predictive modeling, and policy formulation.
